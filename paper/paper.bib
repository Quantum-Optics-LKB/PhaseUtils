  abstract = {Quantum fluids of light are a novel and promising platform in the exploration of many-body quantum physics. We study here fluids whose constituants are photons. Their interactions are induced by a hot vapor of Rubidium atoms. In order to describe these fluids, we use a Hamiltonian comprising of three terms: kinetic energy, potential energy and interaction energy. In this thesis, we showcase an all-optical control of each of these terms. We evidenced non-classical correlations induced by the interaction quenches at the interfaces of our non-linear medium. We then explore the control of the atomic response of the vapor, using an easily extendable numerical framework. We then use this framework to study optical pumping, that allows us to realize arbitrary potentials inside the fluid of light. The critical velocity for superfluidity is then mesured, in a scattering experiment against an optical defect using the potential engineering developped in this thesis. Finally, we study vortex-vortex interactions in an experiment showcasing turbulent behavior in a fluid of light as well as a collision experiment between vortices. This paves the way to thermodynamics processes seeded by interactions effects beyondthe mean field.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear optics has been a very dynamic field of research with spectacular phenomena discovered mainly after the invention of lasers. The combination of high intensity fields with resonant systems has further enhanced the nonlinearity with specific additional effects related to the resonances. In this paper we review a limited range of these effects which has been studied in the past decades using close-to-room-temperature atomic vapors as the nonlinear resonant medium. In particular we describe four-wave mixing and generation of nonclassical light in atomic vapors. One-and two-mode squeezing as well as photon correlations are discussed. Furthermore, we present some applications for optical and quantum memories based on hot atomic vapors. Finally, we present results on the recently developed field of quantum fluids of light using hot atomic vapors.},

  abstract = {Turbulence in quantum fluids has, surprisingly, a lot in common with its classical counterpart. Recently, cold atomic gases has emerged as a well-controlled experimental platform to study turbulent dynamics. In this work, we introduce a system to study quantum turbulence in optics, with the major advantage of having access to a wide range of characterization tools available for light fields. In particular, we report the temporal dynamics of density and phase and we show the emergence of isotropy in momentum space and the presence of different scaling laws in the incompressible kinetic energy spectrum. The microscopic origin of the algebraic exponents in the energy spectrum is discussed by studying the internal structure of quantized vortices within the healing length and their clustering at larger length scales. These results are obtained using two counterstreaming fluids of light, which allows for a precise preparation of the initial state and the in situ measurement of the compressible and incompressible fluid velocity.}
