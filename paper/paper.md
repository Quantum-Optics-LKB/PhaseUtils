# Summary

Off-axis interferometry is a powerful technique that allows full-field retrieval from interferograms [@lieblingComplexwaveRetrievalSingle2004]
[@verrierOffaxisDigitalHologram2011].
Based on the deconvolution of the inteferograms using Fourier transforms, it allows live monitoring of optical fields.
It comprises of three utilities `contrast`, `velocity` and `SLM`:

- `contrast` is focused on the retrieval of the phase.
- `velocity` is focused on the processing of the complex field.
- `SLM` provides a performant, platform independant window-based tool to control spatial light modulators such as liquid crystal spatial light modulators (LCOS SLM) or digital micro-mirror devices (DMD).

# Statement of need

Phase retrieval is a critical topic in all optics experiment.
It is often challenging since cameras can only access intensity information.
The solution to this problem is spatially heterodyning a target signal with a reference signal using the interference signal to recover the phase.
This is the so-called off-axis interferometry technique [@verrierOffaxisDigitalHologram2011].
It allows a singe shot, high resolution retrieval of the full complex optical field.

`PhaseUtils` harnesses the power of modern FFT algorithms to deliver performance focused tools to retrieve and process the phase information of optical fields with its utilities `contrast` and `velocity`.
This allows to compute a large number of observables relevant in the context of quantum fluids of light [@aladjidiFullOpticalControl2023] [@glorieuxHotAtomicVapors2023] [@bakerrasooliTurbulentDynamicsTwodimensional2023].
`velocity` implements all of the observables introduced in [@bradleyEnergySpectraVortex2012] and implemented in the `Julia` package [`QuantumFluidSpectra.jl`](https://github.com/AshtonSBradley/QuantumFluidSpectra.jl) [@PhysRevA.106.043322], and extends it by providing a fast tree-based implementation of the vortex clustering algorithm.

It also provide tools with `SLM` to control the optical fields using spatial light modulators, implementing holography techniques such as [@bolducExactSolutionSimultaneous2013].
This utility was inspired by [@sebastien_m_popoff_2017_293042] and implements the same basic functionalities, using a faster backend (`opencv`).
Since it functions by instantiating a graphical window, it can be used for any spatial light modulator that is recognized as a screen.
It also extends the simple control functionality with all of the relevant functions to
generate arbitrary states of light using these modulators.
These functions use JIT compilation with `numba` for optimal performance to allow for fast live control.
