  abstractNote={We consider a problem of interference between two independent 
  condensates that lack true long-range order. We show that their interference 
  pattern contains information about correlation functions within each condensate. 
  As an example, we analyze the interference between a pair of one-dimensional 
  interacting Bose liquids. We find universal scaling of the average fringe 
  contrast with system size and temperature that depends only on the Luttinger 
  parameter. Moreover, the full distribution of the fringe contrast, which is also 
  equivalent to the full counting statistics of the interfering atoms, changes with 
  interaction strength and lends information on high-order correlation functions. We 
  also demonstrate that the interference between two-dimensional condensates at finite
   temperature can be used as a direct probe of the Kosterlitz–Thouless transition. 
   Finally, we discuss the generalization of our results to describe the interference 
   of a periodic array of independent fluctuating condensates.},

The mechanical stresses caused by manufacturing, thermal mismatch and Lorenz forces closely influence electromagnetic performance during operation for REBCO CCs. In addition, the recently studied screen currents have effects on the mechanical characteristics of high-field REBCO magnets. In this review, the experimental and main theoretical works on critical current degradation, delamination and fatigue, and shear investigations on REBCO CCs, are reviewed at first. Then, research progress on the screening-current effect in the development of high-field superconducting magnets is introduced. Finally, the key mechanical problems facing the future development of high-field magnets based on REBCO CCs are prospected.}",

	abstract = {This report addresses topics and questions of common interest in the fields of ultra-cold gases and nuclear physics in the context of the BCS–BEC crossover. By this crossover, the phenomena of Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) superfluidity and Bose–Einstein condensation (BEC), which share the same kind of spontaneous symmetry breaking, are smoothly connected through the progressive reduction of the size of the fermion pairs involved as the fundamental entities in both phenomena. This size ranges, from large values when Cooper pairs are strongly overlapping in the BCS limit of a weak inter-particle attraction, to small values when composite bosons are non-overlapping in the BEC limit of a strong inter-particle attraction, across the intermediate unitarity limit where the size of the pairs is comparable with the average inter-particle distance. The BCS–BEC crossover has recently been realized experimentally, and essentially in all of its aspects, with ultra-cold Fermi gases. This realization, in turn, has raised the interest of the nuclear physics community in the crossover problem, since it represents an unprecedented tool to test fundamental and unanswered questions of nuclear many-body theory. Here, we focus on the several aspects of the BCS–BEC crossover, which are of broad joint interest to both ultra-cold Fermi gases and nuclear matter, and which will likely help to solve in the future some open problems in nuclear physics (concerning, for instance, neutron stars). Similarities and differences occurring in ultra-cold Fermi gases and nuclear matter will then be emphasized, not only about the relative phenomenologies but also about the theoretical approaches to be used in the two contexts. Common to both contexts is the fact that at zero temperature the BCS–BEC crossover can be described at the mean-field level with reasonable accuracy. At finite temperature, on the other hand, inclusion of pairing fluctuations beyond mean field represents an essential ingredient of the theory, especially in the normal phase where they account for precursor pairing effects. After an introduction to present the key concepts of the BCS–BEC crossover, this report discusses the mean-field treatment of the superfluid phase, both for homogeneous and inhomogeneous systems, as well as for symmetric (spin- or isospin-balanced) and asymmetric (spin- or isospin-imbalanced) matter. Pairing fluctuations in the normal phase are then considered, with their manifestations in thermodynamic and dynamic quantities. The last two Sections provide a more specialized discussion of the BCS–BEC crossover in ultra-cold Fermi gases and nuclear matter, respectively. The separate discussion in the two contexts aims at cross communicating to both communities topics and aspects which, albeit arising in one of the two fields, share a strong common interest.},

abstract = {During the last ten years, superconducting circuits have passed from being interesting physical devices to becoming contenders for near-future useful and scalable quantum information processing (QIP). Advanced quantum simulation experiments have been shown with up to nine qubits, while a demonstration of quantum supremacy with fifty qubits is anticipated in just a few years. Quantum supremacy means that the quantum system can no longer be simulated by the most powerful classical supercomputers. Integrated classical-quantum computing systems are already emerging that can be used for software development and experimentation, even via web interfaces.

Therefore, the time is ripe for describing some of the recent development of superconducting devices, systems and applications. As such, the discussion of superconducting qubits and circuits is limited to devices that are proven useful for current or near future applications. Consequently, the centre of interest is the practical applications of QIP, such as computation and simulation in Physics and Chemistry.}

Here we perform such a measurement for a direct energy cascade in a turbulent quantum gas. Using a time-periodic force, we inject energy at a large lengthscale and generate a cascade in a uniformly-trapped Bose gas. The adjustable trap depth provides a high-momentum cutoff \$k\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{D\}\}\$, which realises a synthetic dissipation scale. This gives us direct access to the particle flux across a momentum shell of radius \$k\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{D\}\}\$, and the tunability of \$k\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{D\}\}\$ allows for a clear demonstration of the zeroth law of turbulence: we observe that for fixed forcing the particle flux vanishes as \$k\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{D\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ in the dissipationless limit \$k\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{D\}\}{\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty\$, while the energy flux is independent of \$k\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{D\}\}\$.

	abstract = {We investigate two-dimensional turbulence in finite-temperature trapped Bose-Einstein condensates within damped Gross-Pitaevskii theory. Turbulence is produced via circular motion of a Gaussian potential barrier stirring the condensate. We systematically explore a range of stirring parameters and identify three regimes, characterized by the injection of distinct quantum vortex structures into the condensate: (A) periodic vortex dipole injection, (B) irregular injection of a mixture of vortex dipoles and co-rotating vortex clusters, and (C) continuous injection of oblique solitons that decay into vortex dipoles. Spectral analysis of the kinetic energy associated with vortices reveals that regime (B) can intermittently exhibit a Kolmogorov k−5/3 power law over almost a decade of length or wave-number (k) scales. The kinetic energy spectrum of regime (C) exhibits a clear k−3/2 power law associated with an inertial range for weak-wave turbulence and a k−7/2 power law for high wave numbers. We thus identify distinct regimes of forcing for generating either two-dimensional quantum turbulence or classical weak-wave turbulence that may be realizable experimentally.},

Although classical turbulence is ubiquitous in nature, the observation of quantum turbulence requires the precise manipulation of quantum fluids such as superfluid helium or atomic Bose–Einstein condensates. Here we demonstrate the turbulent dynamics of a two-dimensional quantum fluid of exciton–polaritons, hybrid light–matter quasiparticles, both by measuring the kinetic energy spectrum and showing the onset of vortex clustering. We demonstrate that the formation of clusters of quantum vortices is triggered by the increase of the incompressible kinetic energy per vortex, showing the tendency of the vortex-gas towards highly excited configurations despite the dissipative nature of our system. These results lay the basis for investigations of quantum turbulence in two-dimensional fluids of light.},

	abstract = {In quantum fluids, the quantization of circulation forbids the diffusion of a vortex swirling flow seen in classical viscous fluids. Yet, accelerating quantum vortices may lose their energy into acoustic radiations1,2, similar to the way electric charges decelerate on emitting photons. The dissipation of vortex energy underlies central problems in quantum hydrodynamics3, such as the decay of quantum turbulence, highly relevant to systems as varied as neutron stars, superfluid helium and atomic condensates4,5. A deep understanding of the elementary mechanisms behind irreversible vortex dynamics has been a goal for decades3,6, but it is complicated by the shortage of conclusive experimental signatures7. Here we address this challenge by realizing a programmable vortex collider in a planar, homogeneous atomic Fermi superfluid with tunable inter-particle interactions. We create on-demand vortex configurations and monitor their evolution, taking advantage of the accessible time and length scales of ultracold Fermi gases8,9. Engineering collisions within and between vortex–antivortex pairs allows us to decouple relaxation of the vortex energy due to sound emission and that due to interactions with normal fluid (that is, mutual friction). We directly visualize how the annihilation of vortex dipoles radiates a sound pulse. Further, our few-vortex experiments extending across different superfluid regimes reveal non-universal dissipative dynamics, suggesting that fermionic quasiparticles localized inside the vortex core contribute significantly to dissipation, thereby opening the route to exploring new pathways for quantum turbulence decay, vortex by vortex.},

Light that is not diffracted into the first order is sent into the zero order, effectively allowing for amplitude modulation of either the first-order or the zero-order diffracted light. This technique has several applications in both optical pattern recognition and image processing, including amplitude modulation and inverse filters.

We observe, in the noncondensed fraction of the gas, a HBT bunching whose properties strongly deviate from the HBT signals expected for noninteracting bosons. In addition, we show that the measured correlations reflect the peculiar quantum statistics of atoms belonging to the quantum depletion and of the Bogoliubov phonons, i.e., of collective excitations of the many-body quantum state. Our results demonstrate that atom-atom correlations provide information about the quantum state of interacting particles, extending the interest of HBT-like experiments beyond the case of noninteracting particles.},

If dimensionality is reduced, thermal fluctuations destroy a system's spatial order and most phase transitions, like those responsible for ferromagnetism for instance, cannot occur. But there is a particular type of phase transition, involving the pairing of vortices, that does exist in two dimensions. First predicted 30 years ago by Berezinskii, Kosterlitz and Thouless, the ‘BKT transition’ has now been observed directly for the first time in a planar gas of ultracold rubidium atoms.},

              appeared near a temperature of 170 nanokelvin and a number density of 2.5 × 1012 per
              cubic centimeter and could be preserved for more than 15 seconds. Three primary 
              signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation were seen. (i) On top of a broad thermal
              velocity distribution, a narrow peak appeared that was centered at zero velocity.
              (ii) The fraction of the atoms that were in this low-velocity peak increased abruptly
              as the sample temperature was lowered. (iii) The peak exhibited a nonthermal, 
              anisotropic velocity distribution expected of the minimum-energy quantum state of

This small-dimensions and low-cost device can be connected to the output of a transmission microscope illuminated by a low-coherence source and measure sub-nanometric optical thickness changes in a label-free manner. In contrast to our previously published design, the $\tau$ interferometer, the new design is able to fully operate in an off-axis holographic geometry, where the interference fringes have high spatial frequency, and the interference area is limited only by the coherence length of the source, and thus it enables to easily obtain high-quality quantitative images of static and dynamic samples. We present several applications for the new design including nondestructive optical testing of transparent microscopic elements with nanometric thickness and live-cell imaging.}

When the strength of interactions was suddenly changed in a two-dimensional gas of cesium atoms, Hung et al. (p. 1213, published online 1 August; see the Perspective by Schmiedmayer and Berges) observed oscillations in the time and space domains analogous to the peaks in the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background.Predicting the dynamics of many-body systems far from equilibrium is a challenging theoretical problem. A long-predicted phenomenon in hydrodynamic nonequilibrium systems is the occurrence of Sakharov oscillations, which manifest in the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background and the large-scale correlations of galaxies. Here, we report the observation of Sakharov oscillations in the density fluctuations of a quenched atomic superfluid through a systematic study in both space and time domains and with tunable interaction strengths. Our work suggests a different approach to the study of nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems and the exploration of their analogs in cosmology and astrophysics.},

  abstract = {It is a deceptively simple question to ask how acoustic disturbances propagate in a non-homogeneous flowing fluid. Subject to suitable restrictions, this question can be answered by invoking the language of Lorentzian differential geometry. This paper begins with a pedagogical derivation of the following result: if the fluid is barotropic and inviscid, and the flow is irrotational (though possibly time dependent), then the equation of motion for the velocity potential describing a sound wave is identical to that for a minimally coupled massless scalar field propagating in a (3 + 1)-dimensional Lorentzian geometry \#\#{IMG}\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0264-9381/15/6/024/img1.gif] The acoustic metric \#\#{IMG}\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0264-9381/15/6/024/img2.gif] governing the propagation of sound depends algebraically on the density, flow velocity, and local speed of sound. Even though the underlying fluid dynamics is Newtonian, non-relativistic, and takes place in flat space plus time, the fluctuations (sound waves) are governed by an effective (3 + 1)-dimensional Lorentzian spacetime geometry. This rather simple physical system exhibits a remarkable connection between classical Newtonian physics and the differential geometry of curved (3 + 1)-dimensional Lorentzian spacetimes, and is the basis underlying a deep and fruitful analogy between the black holes of Einstein gravity and supersonic fluid flows. Many results and definitions can be carried over directly from one system to another. For example, it will be shown how to define the ergosphere, trapped regions, acoustic apparent horizon, and acoustic event horizon for a supersonic fluid flow, and the close relationship between the acoustic metric for the fluid flow surrounding a point sink and the Painlevé-Gullstrand form of the Schwarzschild metric for a black hole will be exhibited. This analysis can be used either to provide a concrete non-relativistic analogy for black-hole physics, or to provide a framework for attacking acoustics problems with the full power of Lorentzian differential geometry.},

We also analyze the blinking for some stable {PQDs} and find a continuous distribution of emission states with a linear correlation between intensity and lifetime.

Surface ligands as surface passivators are essential components of nucleation and growth processes, photoluminescence quantum yields ({PL} {QY}), stability, and photoelectric applications. In this review, the relationship of perovskite structure modified is outlined by surface ligand and some properties on account of the ion structure features. This review specifically focuses on the roles of surface ligands in the construction of {IHP} {NCs} with fewer defects, higher {PL} {QY}, and better stability. Generally, ligands binding to the surface of {IHP} {NCs} can form passivation layer, which are beneficial to not only the improvement of {PL} {QY} by filling the Br− or Pb2+ vacancy but also the enhancement of stability. The surface passivation mechanisms are attributed to the [Br⋯HN+] hydrogen-bonding, chelation, and dative covalent bond interactions. Furthermore, degradation mechanisms assigned to the hydration, ion migration, and dissociation are discussed. The equilibrium problem of purifying and {QY} and possible reasons are also addressed, which are believed to be solved in the near future with the help of coordination chemistry and surface engineering. Finally, a brief outlook including challenges and possible development is provided.},

  abstract = {Lead-halide perovskite {APbX}3 (A = Cs or organic cation; X = Cl, Br, I) nanocrystals ({NCs}) are the subject of intense research due to their exceptional characteristics as both classical and quantum light sources. Many challenges often faced with this material class concern the longterm optical stability, a serious intrinsic issue connected with the labile and polar crystal structure of {APbX}3 compounds. When conducting spectroscopy at a single particle level, due to the highly enhanced contaminants (e.g., water molecules, oxygen) over the {NC} ratio, deterioration of {NC} optical properties occurs within tens of seconds with typically used excitation power densities (1−100 W/cm2) and in ambient conditions. Here, we demonstrate that choosing a suitable polymer matrix is of paramount importance for obtaining stable spectra from a single {NC} and for suppressing the dynamic photoluminescence blueshift. In particular, polystyrene ({PS}), the most hydrophobic among four tested polymers, leads to the best optical stability, one to two orders of magnitude higher than that obtained with poly(methyl methacrylate), a common polymeric encapsulant containing polar ester groups. Molecular mechanics simulations based on a force-ﬁeld approximation corroborate the hypothesis that {PS} aﬀords for a denser molecular packing at the {NC} surface. These ﬁndings underscore the often-neglected role of the sample preparation methodologies for the assessment of the optical properties of perovskite {NCs} at a single-particle level and guide the further design of robust single photon sources.},

However, the understanding of exciton many-body interactions manifested through the transient biexcitonic Stark eﬀect at the early time scales and the Auger recombination process in this new class of materials still remains rather incomplete. In this Article, we studied the many-body exciton interactions under controlled conditions through ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. A large biexcitonic redshift ∼30 {meV} to the eﬀect of hot excitations on the excitonic resonance is observed at the early time scales. From the ﬂuence-dependent studies, it is evident that the samples have only single and biexciton lifetimes, suggesting that the band edges are 2-fold degenerate. This explicit experimental evidence for the exciton many-body interactions in {CsPbBr}3 nanocrystals provides a powerful tool to explore the development of their prospective applications in light-emitting devices, lasers, and solar cells.},

In this paper, all-inorganic perovskites {CsPbX}3 (X ¼Cl, Br and I) quantum dots ({QDs}) with tunable ﬂuorescence from 400 nm to 700 nm were prepared by a facile hot-injection method. Besides, random lasing with coherent feedback was observed in ﬁlms of {CsPbX}3 {QDs}. Under 400 nm optical excitation at room temperature, sharp lasing peaks emission at around 427 nm, 527 nm and 539 nm with low pump thresholds intensity were achieved by halide substitution. The dynamic ﬂuorescence from one single quantum dot also was detailed investigated. These results demonstrated that all-inorganic perovskites could be used as low-threshold and wavelength-tunable gain materials for lasing application at roomtemperature.},

Upon increasing the nanocrystal concentration in solution, a constant drop in photoluminescence quantum yield is observed, accompanied by a significant {PL} red shift. This effect is reversible, and the original {PL} can be restored by diluting to the original concentration. We show that this effect can be in part attributed to self-absorption and partly to aggregation. In particular, for nanoplatelets, where the aggregation is mostly irreversible, while the self-absorption effect is reversible, the two contributions can be well separated. Finally, when dry solid-state films are prepared, the emission band is shifted into the green spectral region, close to the bulk {CsPbBr}3 band gap, thus preventing blue emission from such films.},

In addition, all-inorganic ({CsPbX}3) perovskite {QDs} are suggested to be efficient single photon emitting centers. Herein, we study the photon emission properties of recently synthesized organic–inorganic {FAPbBr}3 {QDs}. Our results show that individual {FAPbBr}3 {QDs} can act as good single-photon sources with very low multiphoton emission probability achieved by extremely fast nonradiative Auger recombination. However, they exhibit photodegradation and fluorescence intensity intermittency, called blinking. By analyzing the {ON}({OFF}) duration time distribution, particularly the {OFF} duration times, we suggest that two types of blinking (type-A and type-B) simultaneously contribute to the blinking behavior of {FAPbBr}3 {QDs}. In type-A and type-B blinking, the {ON}/{OFF} periods are attributed to charged/discharged states and to activation/deactivation of fast nonradiative recombination centers, respectively. By analyzing the {ON}/{OFF} duration cutoff time as a function of the excitation intensity, we verify that type-A blinking is caused mainly by diffusion-controlled electron transfer, partially accompanied by Auger ionization processes.},

The nucleation and growth of the platelets, which takes place at room temperature, is triggered by the injection of acetone in a mixture of precursors that would remain unreactive otherwise. The low growth temperature enables the control of the plate thickness, which can be precisely tuned from 3 to 5 monolayers. The strong two-dimensional confinement of the carriers at such small vertical sizes is responsible for a narrow {PL}, strong excitonic absorption, and a blue shift of the optical band gap by more than 0.47 {eV} compared to that of bulk {CsPbBr}3. We also show that the composition of the {NPLs} can be varied all the way to {CsPbBr}3 or {CsPbI}3 by anion exchange, with preservation of the size and shape of the starting particles. The blue fluorescent {CsPbCl}3 {NPLs} represent a new member of the scarcely populated group of blue-emitting colloidal nanocrystals. The exciton dynamics were found to be independent of the extent of 2D confinement in these platelets, and this was supported by band structure calculations.},

We demonstrate enhanced water and light stability of high-surface-area colloidal perovskite nanocrystals by encapsulation of colloidal {CsPbBr}3 quantum dots into matched hydrophobic macroscale polymeric matrices. This is achieved by mixing the quantum dots with presynthesized high-molecular-weight polymers. We monitor the photoluminescence quantum yield of the perovskite–polymer nanocomposite films under water-soaking for the first time, finding no change even after {\textgreater}4 !months of continuous immersion in water. Furthermore, photostability is greatly enhanced in the macroscale polymer-encapsulated nanocrystal perovskites, which sustain {\textgreater}1010 absorption events per quantum dot prior to photodegradation, a significant threshold for potential device use. Control of the quantum dot shape in these thin-film polymer composite enables color tunability via strong quantum-confinement in nanoplates and significant room temperature polarized emission from perovskite nanowires. Not only does the high-molecular-weight polymer protect the perovskites from the environment but also no escaped lead was detected in water that was in contact with the encapsulated perovskites for !months. Our ligand-passivated perovskite-macroscale polymer composites provide a robust platform for diverse photonic applications.},

The defect tolerance of lead halide perovskites oﬀers an impetus to search for similar attributes in other related heavy metal-free compounds. We discuss the origins of the signiﬁcantly blue-shifted emission from {CsPbBr}3 nanocrystals and the synthetic strategies toward fabrication of stable perovskite nanocrystal materials with emission in the red and infrared parts of the optical spectrum, which are related to fabrication of mixed cation compounds guided by Goldschmidt tolerance factor considerations.

One can use media with extremely low group velocities [Lene Vestergaard Hau et al., Nature (London) 397, 594 (1999)] to create dielectric analogs of astronomical effects on Earth. In particular, a vortex flow imprints a long-ranging topological effect on incident light and can behave like an optical black hole.},

A thermal low-frequency part of the spectrum is expected even when dispersive effects become significant. We consider the two most common class of weak-dispersive media and investigate all possible anomalous scattering processes due inhomogeneous background flows. We first argue that under minimal assumptions, the scattering processes in near-critical flows are well described by a linearized Kortewegâ€“de Vries equation. Within our theoretical model grey-body factors are neglected, that is, the mode comoving with the flow decouples from the other ones. We also exhibit a flow example with an exact expression for the effective temperature. We see that this temperature coincides with the Hawking one only when the dispersive length scale is much smaller than the flow gradient scale. We apply the same method in inhomogeneous flows without an analogue horizon. In this case, the spectrum coefficients decrease with decreasing frequencies. Our findings are in agreement with previous numerical works, generalizing their findings to arbitrary flow pro!files. Our analytical expressions provide estimates to guide ongoing experimental efforts.},

We show that in one-dimensional flows displaying an analogue horizon, the Hawking effect is dominant in the low-frequency regime. This happens despite nonvanishing grey-body factors, that is, the coupling of the Hawking mode and its partner to the mode propagating with the flow. To show this, we obtained analytical expressions for the scattering coefficients, in general flows and taking into account the full Bogoliubov dispersion relation. We discuss the obtained expressions for the grey-body factors. In particular, we show that they can be significantly decreased if the flow obeys a conformal coupling condition. We argue that in the presence of a small but non-zero temperature, reducing grey-body factors greatly facilitates the observation of entanglement, that is, establishing that the state of the Hawking mode and its partner is non-separable.},

Further corrections can be characterized as quantum scattering events, which appear in the form of a nonlinear response of the observable to an infinitesimal displacement of the field along its classical evolution. At the end of the paper we give a few numerical examples to test the formalism.},

  abstract = {Light experiences a nonuniformly moving medium as an effective gravitational field, endowed with an effective metric tensor ˜gμν=ημν+(n2−1)uμuν, n being the refractive index and uμ the four-velocity of the medium. Leonhardt and Piwnicki [Phys. Rev. A 60, 4301 (1999)] argued that a flowing dielectric fluid of this kind can be used to generate an “optical black hole.” In the Leonhardt-Piwnicki model, only a vortex flow was considered. It was later pointed out by Visser [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 5252 (2000)] that in order to form a proper optical black hole containing an event horizon, it becomes necessary to add an inward radial velocity component to the vortex flow. In the present paper we undertake this task: we consider a full spiral flow, consisting of a vortex component plus a radially infalling component. Light propagates in such a dielectric medium in a way similar to that occurring around a rotating black hole. We calculate, and show graphically, the effective potential versus the radial distance from the vortex singularity, and show that the spiral flow can always capture light in both a positive, and a negative, inverse impact parameter interval. The existence of a genuine event horizon is found to depend on the strength of the radial flow, relative to the strength of the azimuthal flow. A limitation of our fluid model is that it is nondispersive.},

While there are numerous experimental platforms in which classical amplification (at the event horizon or the ergoregion) has been observed, there is a dearth of experimental evidence for quantum emission. Fortunately, horizons in fluids of light are predicted to emit Hawking radiation with a clear quantum correlation signature. Here, we demonstrate how optically generating a defect in a polariton microcavity enables the creation of one- and two-dimensional, transsonic fluids flows. We show that this highly tuneable method permits the creation of horizons. Furthermore, we present a rotating geometry with an ergoregion and an inner horizon. These experiments usher-in the possibility of observing stimulated as well as spontaneous amplification by the Hawking, Penrose and Zeld'ovich effects.},

When the flow is slow enough, the quantum gas enters a superfluid regime and neither whirlpools nor waves form around the obstacle. For higher flow velocities, it has been predicted that the perturbation induced by the defect gives rise to the turbulent emission of quantised vortices and to the nucleation of solitons. Using an interacting Bose gas of exciton-polaritons in a semiconductor microcavity, we report the transition from superfluidity to the hydrodynamic formation of oblique dark solitons and vortex streets in the wake of a potential barrier. The direct observation of these topological excitations provides key information on the mechanisms of superflow and shows the potential of polariton condensates for quantum turbulence studies.},

This is done by considering the propagation of sound waves in a radial flow with constant velocity. We show that the equation of motion satisfied by sound waves is the wave equation on {AdS}2×S1. Since this spacetime is not globally hyperbolic, the dynamics of the Klein-Gordon field is not well defined until boundary conditions at the spatial boundary of {AdS}2 are prescribed. On the analogue model end, those extra boundary conditions provide an effective description of the point source at r=0.

Although strong {GW} producing events are rare and currently unpredictable, {GWs} can in principle be simulated in analogue systems at will in the lab. Simulation of {GWs} in a manifestly quantum system would allow for the study of the interaction of quantum phenomena with {GWs}. Such predicted interaction is exploited in a recently proposed Bose-Einstein condensate ({BEC}) based {GW} detector. In this paper, we show how to manipulate a {BEC} to mimic the effect of a passing {GW}. By simultaneously varying the external potential applied to the {BEC}, and an external magnetic field near a Feshbach resonance, we show that the resulting change in speed of sound can directly reproduce a {GW} metric. We also show how to simulate a metric used in the recently proposed {BEC} based {GW} detector, to provide an environment for testing the proposed metrology scheme of the detector. Explicit expressions for simulations of various {GW} sources are given. This result is also useful to generally test the interaction of quantum phenomena with {GWs} in a curved spacetime analogue experiment.},

While initially envisioned in terms of the scattering of an incident wave directed perpendicular to an object's rotation axis, we demonstrate in the context of acousto-mechanics that superradiant amplification can also occur with a vortex beam directed parallel to the rotation axis. We propose two different experimental routes: one must either work with rotations high enough that the tangential velocity at the outer edge of the disk exceeds the speed of sound, or use evanescent sound waves. We argue that the latter possibility is more promising, and provides the opportunity to probe a previously unexamined parameter regime in the acoustics of rotating porous media.},

We propose a new model for the background flow which takes into account the varying depth of the water. Numerical integration of the associated Klein-Gordon equation using accessible experimental parameters shows that gravity waves in an appropriate frequency range are amplified through the mechanism of superradiance. Our numerical results suggest that the observation of this phenomenon in a common fluid mechanical system is within experimental reach. Unlike the case of wave scattering around Kerr black holes, which depends only on one dimensionless background parameter (the ratio \$a/M\$ between the specific angular momentum and the mass of the black hole), our system depends on two dimensionless background parameters, namely the normalized angular velocity and surface gravity at the effective black hole horizon.},

Carusotto [Phys. Rev. A 87, 023803 (2013)]. We expand the use of this model to calculate explicitly spectra of all modes of positive and negative norms. Furthermore, for lower step heights we obtain a unique set of mode configurations encompassing black-hole and white-hole setups. This leads to a realistic emission spectrum featuring black-hole and white-hole emission for different frequencies. We also present spectra as measured in the laboratory frame that include all modes, in particular a dominant negative-norm mode, which is the partner mode in any Hawking-type emission. We find that the emission spectrum is highly structured into intervals of emission with black-hole, white-hole, and no horizons. Finally, we estimate the number of photons emitted as a function of the step height and find a power law of 2.5 for low step heights.},

For each system the transient fluorescence “intensity”, {ICW}(t) (i.e., detected photons/dwell time), has been recorded with continuous wave ({CW}) irradiation. {ICW}(t) has been analyzed to yield an occurrence histogram for the different “intensities”, H(I), and an intensity time-autocorrelation function {CI}(t). The histograms H(I) for the various examples show highly diverse behavior with one, two, or even three peaks as well as “flat regions”. The different features in the histograms are shown to arise from distinct photophysical processes. From the study of model systems, characteristic features in the intensity histograms and autocorrelation functions are shown to result from photon shot noise, “blinking” due to triplet bottlenecks, spectral diffusion due to environmental fluctuations, and interchromophoric energy transfer. Classification of the relevant photophysical processes is aided by single molecule spectroscopic data on these systems, including wavelength-resolved emission spectroscopy and “two-color excitation spectroscopy”, as well as stochastic simulations. The results indicate that a combined analysis of H(I) and {CI}(t) is a valuable approach in sorting out single molecule behavior involving multiple photophysical processes in complex systems. For single molecule systems that exhibit “on−off blinking” involving the formation of dark states, the paper also explores the practical advantages of studying the duration histograms (H(ton) and H(toff)) versus the intensity autocorrelation function {CI}(t), for quantifying the underlying photophysical dynamics.},

In addition, their strongly size-dependent optical properties render them attractive candidates as tunable light absorbers and emitters in optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting diodes3,4 and quantum-dot lasers5,6, and as optical probes of biological systems7. Here we show that light emission from single fluorescing nanocrystals of cadmium selenide under continuous excitation turns on and off intermittently with a characteristic timescale of about 0.5 seconds. This intermittency is not apparent from ensemble measurements on many nanocrystals. The dependence on excitation intensity and the change in on/off times when a passivating, high-bandgap shell of zinc sulphide encapsulates the nanocrystal8,9 suggests that the abrupt turning off of luminescence is caused by photo-ionization of the nanocrystal. Thus spectroscopic measurements on single nanocrystals can reveal hitherto unknown aspects of their photophysics.},

  abstract = {To explore the relationship between local electromagnetic field enhancement and the large {SERS} (surface enhanced Raman scattering) enhancement that enables the observation of single molecule Raman spectra, we measure both resonant Rayleigh scattering spectra and rhodamine 6G Raman spectra from single Ag particles. Our apparatus combines the techniques of dark-field optical microscopy for resonant Rayleigh measurements, and grazing incidence Raman spectroscopy. The Rayleigh spectra show that the citrate-reduced Ag colloid is extremely heterogeneous. Only the larger particles, in part created by salt induced aggregation, show a large {SERS} effect. In agreement with the work of Nie and Emory, we find that a few nanocrystals show huge single molecule R6G {SERS} intensities. While all {SERS} active particles have some resonant Rayleigh scattering at the 514.5 nm laser wavelength, there is no correlation between the resonant Rayleigh spectra and the {SERS} intensity. We discuss a model in which huge {SERS} intensities result from single chemisorbed molecules interacting with ballistic electrons in optically excited large Ag particles. This model is a natural consequence of the standard local electromagnetic field model for {SERS} and the high surface sensitivity of plasmon dephasing in the noble metals.},

Wild-type {GFP} and its mutant have attracted interest as fluorescent biological labels because the fluorophore may be formed in vivo15,16. {GFP} mutants immobilized in aereated aqueous polymer gels and excited by 488-nm light undergo repeated cycles of fluorescent emission (‘blinking’) on a timescale of several seconds—behaviour that would be unobservable in bulk studies. Eventually the individual {GFP} molecules reach a long-lasting dark state, from which they can be switched back to the original emissive state by irradiation at 405 nm. This suggests the possibility of using these {GFPs} as fluorescent markers for time-dependent cell processes, and as molecular photonic switches or optical storage elements, addressable on the single-molecule level.},

  abstract    = {Semiconductor nanostructures are a class of materials that have many attractive properties for optoelectronic applications and incorporation into solid-state devices. Compared to bulk semiconductors, they offer discrete, tunable electronic energy levels and an enhancement of many charge carrier interactions. Improving our understanding of the charge dynamics in these materials and how their behavior fundamentally differs from bulk solids will be crucial for ongoing and future development of semiconductor nanostructure devices. In this dissertation, the use of single particle spectroscopy to probe charge carrier dynamics in semiconductor nanostructures is described.The first introductory chapter provides an overview of some elementary background knowledge regarding the unique electronic structure of confined semiconductors and how this results in their distinct carrier dynamics. The advantages of single particle experiments are discussed as well as the detection methods available to obtain a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio, focusing primarily on the photoluminescence ({PL}) detection of a single optically excited particle. Finally, {PL} blinking in single semiconductor nanocrystals ({NCs}) is introduced and the leading theories proposed to account for the phenomenon are summarized. The second chapter details an experimental setup optimized for studying the {PL} emission from single particles, including an ultrafast, tunable laser system as the excitation source, a confocal microscope to obtain a small focal volume for single particle excitation, and the detection and acquisition components, namely sensitive photodiodes and time-correlated single photon counting techniques.The subsequent three chapters present results from a range of semiconductor nano-materials. The third and fourth chapters focus on {PL} blinking in semiconductor {NCs}, beginning with the use of {PL} blinking results in thick-shell {CdSe}/{CdS} chalcogenide {NCs} to compare the effectiveness of two distinct analysis methods for probing multi-level emission. Extending to lead halide {CsPbBr}3 perovskite {NCs}, {PL} blinking is investigated to understand how charge trapping in these newly available compositions compares to traditional chalcogenide {NCs}. The next chapter provides three condensed summaries of {PL} studies in semiconductor nanowires ({NWs}). Time-resolved {PL} experiments of colloidal {CsPbX}3 (X = Cl, Br, I) {NWs} and {InP} {NWs} are detailed, and a spectroscopic study of stimulated emission in isolated {CsPbBr}3 {NWs} is described. Finally, the last chapter offers concluding remarks of the dissertation as well as a glimpse into the possible future directions of the laboratory.},

Expectation−maximization clustering and the Bayesian information criterion is then used for accurate determination of the true number of states accessible to the system.

Every {QD} shows a similar power-law behavior for the off-time distribution regardless of temperature, excitation intensity, surface morphology or size. We propose a dynamic model of tunneling between core and trapped charged states to explain the universal power-law statistics of the blinking events observed. The on-time probability distributions show evidence of both a tunneling mechanism similar to the off-time statistics and a secondary, photoinduced process that leads to a truncation of the power law. The same blinking statistics are also observed for single {CdTe} nanocrystal {QD}’s.},

We reveal and characterize dark excitons injected by non-resonant pulsed excitation in a semiconductor microcavity structure containing {InGaAs}/{GaAs} quantum wells by monitoring their interactions with the bright lower polariton mode. We find a surprisingly long dark exciton lifetime of more than 20 ns which is longer than the time delay between two consecutive pulses. This creates a memory effect that we clearly observe through the variation of the time-resolved transmission signal. We propose a rate equation model that provides a quantitative agreement with the experimental data.},

Using resonant pump-probe spectroscopy with selective excitation of single polariton branches, we investigate the different dephasing mechanisms responsible for generating a long-lived exciton reservoir. As expected, pumping the upper polariton results in a strong dephasing process that leads to the generation of a long lived reservoir. Unexpectedly, we observe an efficient reservoir creation while exciting only the lower polariton branch when the detuning is increased towards positive detuning. We propose a simple theoretical model, the polaritonic Bloch equations, to describe the dynamics of the system.},

We show that this well known approach does not sucessfully model the data obtained in the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld. Hence, a more complex and complete model that explicitly includes all of the hyperﬁne magnetic sublevels (a multilevel model) is presented. This approach accurately models all of the data collected. The good agreement betweeen this model and the data allows the determination of the transit relaxation rate (due to atomic time of ﬂight through the laser beam), t = (1.13 ± 0.20)vrms/D, where vrms is the two-dimensional root-mean-squared speed of the atom and D is the {FWHM} of the Gaussian laser beam spatial proﬁle.},

Calculations are performed by means of a quantum Monte Carlo technique based on the Wigner representation of the coupled exciton and cavity-photon fields. The numerical results are interpreted in terms of a nonequilibrium phase transition occurring at the parametric oscillation threshold: below the threshold, the signal emission is incoherent, and both the first and the second-order coherence functions have a finite correlation length which becomes macroscopic as the threshold is approached. Above the threshold, the emission is instead phase coherent over the whole two-dimensional sample and intensity fluctuations are suppressed. Similar calculations for quasi-one-dimensional microcavities show that in this case the phase coherence of the signal emission has a finite extension even above the threshold, while intensity fluctuations are suppressed.},

  abstract   = {This article reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in the fundamental understanding and active control of quantum fluids of light in nonlinear optical systems. In presence of effective photon-photon interactions induced by the optical nonlinearity of the medium, a many-photon system can behave collectively as a quantum fluid with a number of novel features stemming from its intrinsically non-equilibrium nature. We present a rich variety of photon hydrodynamical effects that have been recently observed, from the superfluid flow around a defect at low speeds, to the appearance of a Mach-Cherenkov cone in a supersonic flow, to the hydrodynamic formation of topological excitations such as quantized vortices and dark solitons at the surface of large impenetrable obstacles. While our review is mostly focused on a class of semiconductor systems that have been extensively studied in recent years (namely planar semiconductor microcavities in the strong light-matter coupling regime having cavity polaritons as elementary excitations), the very concept of quantum fluids of light applies to a broad spectrum of systems, ranging from bulk nonlinear crystals, to atomic clouds embedded in optical fibers and cavities, to photonic crystal cavities, to superconducting quantum circuits based on Josephson junctions. The conclusive part of our article is devoted to a review of the exciting perspectives to achieve strongly correlated photon gases. In particular, we present different mechanisms to obtain efficient photon blockade, we discuss the novel quantum phases that are expected to appear in arrays of strongly nonlinear cavities, and we point out the rich phenomenology offered by the implementation of artificial gauge fields for photons.},

The trap can be loaded by creating polaritons 50 micrometers from its center that are allowed to drift into the trap. When the density of polaritons exceeds a critical threshold, we observe a number of signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation: spectral and spatial narrowing, a peak at zero momentum in the momentum distribution, first-order coherence, and spontaneous linear polarization of the light emission. The polaritons, which are eigenstates of the light-matter system in a microcavity, remain in the strong coupling regime while going through this dynamical phase transition.
              Polaritons, quasi-particles produced when photons interact with materials, can be trapped within the cavities of a semiconductor and cooled to form a Bose-Einstein condensate.

  abstract = {We report a simple, robust, and inexpensive strategy to enable all-inorganic {CsPbX}3 perovskite nanocrystals ({NCs}) with a set of markedly improved stabilities, that is, water stability, compositional stability, phase stability, and phase segregation stability via impregnating them in solid organic salt matrices (i.e., metal stearate; {MSt}). In addition to acting as matrices, {MSt} also functions as the ligand bound to the surface of {CsPbX}3 {NCs}, thereby eliminating the potential damage of {NCs} commonly encountered during purification as in copious past work. Quite intriguingly, the resulting {CsPbX}3–{MSt} nanocomposites display an outstanding suite of stabilities. First, they retain high emission in the presence of water because of the insolubility of {MSt} in water, signifying their excellent water stability. Second, anion exchange between {CsPbBr}3–{MSt} and {CsPbI}3–{MSt} nanocomposites is greatly suppressed. This can be ascribed to the efficient coating of {MSt}, thus effectively isolating the contact between {CsPbBr}3 and {CsPbI}3 {NCs}, reflecting notable compositional stability. Third, remarkably, after being impregnated by {MSt}, the resulting {CsPbI}3–{MSt} nanocomposites sustain the cubic phase of {CsPbI}3 and high emission, manifesting the strikingly improved phase stability. Finally, phase segregation of {CsPbBr}1.5I1.5 {NCs} is arrested via the {MSt} encapsulation (i.e., no formation of the respective {CsPbBr}3 and {CsPbI}3), thus rendering pure and stable photoluminescence (i.e., demonstration of phase segregation stability). Notably, when assembled into typical white light-emitting diode architecture, {CsPbBr}1.5I1.5–{MSt} nanocomposites exhibit appealing performance, including a high color rendering index (Ra) and a low color temperature (Tc). As such, the judicious encapsulation of perovskite {NCs} into organic salts represents a facile and robust strategy for creating high-quality solid-state luminophores for use in optoelectronic devices.},

The effect of this inherent defect tolerance, namely the absence of deep trap states, on the photoluminescence ({PL}) of perovskite nanocrystals ({NCs}) is currently not well understood. The {PL} emission of {NCs} fluctuates in time according to power law kinetics ({PL} intermittency, or blinking), a phenomenon that has been explored over the past two decades in a vast array of nanocrystal ({NC}) materials. The kinetics of the blinking process in perovskite {NCs} have not been widely explored. Here, {PL} trajectories of individual orthorhombic cesium lead bromide ({CsPbBr}3) perovskite {NCs} are measured using a range of excitation intensities. The power law kinetics of the bright {NC} state are observed to truncate exponentially at long durations, with a truncation time that decreases with increasing intensity before saturating at an intensity corresponding to an average formation of a single exciton. The results indicate that a diffusion-controlled electron transfer ({DCET}) mechanism is the most likely charge trapping process, while Auger autoionization plays a lesser role. The relevance of the multiple recombination centers ({MRC}) model to the results presented here cannot be ascertained, since the underlying switching mechanism is not currently available. Further experimentation and theoretical work are needed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the photophysics in these emerging materials.},

  abstract   = {We study the truncated Wigner method applied to a weakly interacting spinless Bose-condensed gas which is perturbed away from thermal equilibrium by a time-dependent external potential. The principle of the method is to generate an ensemble of classical fields ψ(r) which samples the Wigner quasi-distribution function of the initial thermal equilibrium density operator of the gas, and then to evolve each classical field with the Gross–Pitaevskii equation. In the first part of the paper we improve the sampling technique over our previous work (Sinatra et al2000 J. Mod. Opt. 47 2629–44) and we test its accuracy against the exactly solvable model of the ideal Bose gas. In the second part of the paper we investigate the conditions of validity of the truncated Wigner method. For short evolution times it is known that the time-dependent Bogoliubov approximation is valid for almost pure condensates. The requirement that the truncated Wigner method reproduces the Bogoliubov prediction leads to the constraint that the number of field modes in the Wigner simulation must be smaller than the number of particles in the gas. For longer evolution times the nonlinear dynamics of the noncondensed modes of the field plays an important role. To demonstrate this we analyse the case of a three-dimensional spatially homogeneous Bose-condensed gas and we test the ability of the truncated Wigner method to correctly reproduce the Beliaev–Landau damping of an excitation of the condensate. We have identified the mechanism which limits the validity of the truncated Wigner method: the initial ensemble of classical fields, driven by the time-dependent Gross–Pitaevskii equation, thermalizes to a classical field distribution at a temperature Tclass which is larger than the initial temperature T of the quantum gas. When Tclass significantly exceeds T a spurious damping is observed in the Wigner simulation. This leads to the second validity condition for the truncated Wigner method, Tclass − T ≪ T, which requires that the maximum energy ϵmax of the Bogoliubov modes in the simulation does not exceed a few {kB} T.},

We make use of a time-domain formulation where superradiance emerges as a transient effect encoded in the amplitudes and phases of propagating localized wave packets. Our findings generalize previous studies in quantum fluids to the case of a non-negligible quantum pressure and can be readily applied also to other physical systems, in particular atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. Finally we discuss ongoing experiments to observe superradiance in photon fluids and how our time domain analysis can be used to characterize superradiant scattering in nonideal experimental conditions.},

  abstract   = {The dark soliton solution of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in one dimension has two parameters that do not change the energy of the solution: the global phase of the condensate wave function and the position of the soliton. These degeneracies appear in the Bogoliubov theory as Bogoliubov modes with zero frequencies and zero norms. These ``zero modes'' cannot be quantized as the usual Bogoliubov quasiparticle harmonic oscillators. They must be treated in a non-perturbative way. In this paper I develop non-perturbative theory of zero modes. This theory provides non-perturbative description of quantum phase diffusion and quantum diffusion of soliton position. An initially well localized wave packet for soliton position is predicted to disperse beyond the width of the soliton.},

This violation can be particularly large near the peaks in the radiation spectrum emitted from a resonant boson structure forming a sonic horizon. As a function of the frequency-dependent Hawking radiation intensity, we analyze the degree of {CS} violation and the maximum violation temperature for a double barrier structure separating two regions of subsonic and supersonic condensate flow. We also consider the case where the resonant sonic horizon is produced by a space-dependent contact interaction. In some cases, {CS} violation can be observed by direct atom counting in a time-of-flight experiment. We show that near the conventional zero-frequency peak, the decisive {CS} violation cannot occur.},

We show that, in this kind of system, the vacuum Rabi frequency ΩR can be a significant fraction of the intersubband transition frequency ω12. This regime of ultrastrong light-matter coupling is enhanced for long-wavelength transitions, because for a given doping density, effective mass and number of quantum wells, the ratio ΩR∕ω12 increases as the square root of the intersubband emission wavelength. We characterize the quantum properties of the ground state (a two-mode squeezed vacuum), which can be tuned in situ by changing the value of ΩR, e.g., through an electrostatic gate. We finally point out how the tunability of the polariton quantum vacuum can be exploited to generate correlated photon pairs out of the vacuum via quantum electrodynamics phenomena reminiscent of the dynamical Casimir effect.},

Fluorescents à température ambiante et synthétisés par voie chimique, ces nanoémetteurs représentent d'excellents candidats pour divers domaines d'application tels que l'éclairage, le marquage biologique ou le photovoltaïque.Mon travail expérimental, s'inscrit dans le développement de ces nanoémetteurs via deux approches différentes : leur couplage avec des nanostructures plasmoniques à 4K et la mise en place de régime d'émission collective.Dans un premier temps, nous avons étudié le couplage de nancoristaux individuels avec des films d'or plan dans le but de réduire les pertes par effet Joule. Tout d'abord, nous nous sommes intéressés à l'influence de la température sur ce couplage. A partir d'expériences de photoluminescence et de simulations numériques effectuées par Gérard Colas des Francs du {LCIB}, nous avons pu mesurer et simuler une forte diminuation de l'accélération du temps caractéristique d'émission des nanocristaux lorsque la température passe de 300K à 4K. Cette diminution est directement liée à une importante diminution des pertes ohmiques des couches d'or. L'efficacité quantique des nanocristaux est ainsi augementée d'un facteur 3. Ensuite, nous avons étudié l'influence de la cristallinité de l'or sur ce couplage. A nouveau une forte réduction de l'accélération de l'émission des nanocristaux a été mesurée sur or cristallin en comparaison avec des couches d'or amorphe. Ces mesures laissent de nouveau présager une réduction des pertes par effet Joule ainsi qu'une augmentation d'au moins un facteur deux de l'efficacité quantique des nanocristaux.Dans un second temps, nous avons effectué les premières caractérisations d'agrégats de nanocristaux enrobés dans une coquille de silice. A température ambiante, nous avons mis en évidence la présence d'interaction de type {FRET} entre les nanocristaux émettant dans le bleu et les nanocristaux émettant dans le rouge. Cette interaction permet ainsi une accélération de l'émission globale des agrégats. A 4K, nous avons observé une modification de la dynamique d'émission des agrégats avec l'apparition de deux échelles de temps différentes. Pour les temps courts, la dynamique d'émission est accélérée et est régie par la recombinaison de l'exciton. Pour les temps longs, la dynamique d'émission est régie par une loi de puissance traduisant ainsi l'apparition de temps caractéristiques d'émission extrêmement longs.},

This representation is based on a perturbative expansion in quantum ﬂuctuations around one of the classical limits. We explicitly analyze expansions around three such limits: (i) corpuscular or Newtonian limit in the coordinate–momentum representation, (ii) wave or Gross–Pitaevskii limit for interacting bosons in the coherent state representation, and (iii) Bloch limit for the spin systems. We discuss both the semiclassical (truncated Wigner) approximation and further quantum corrections appearing in the form of either stochastic quantum jumps along the classical trajectories or the nonlinear response to such jumps. We also discuss how quantum jumps naturally emerge in the analysis of nonequal time correlation functions. This representation of quantum dynamics is closely related to the phase space methods based on the Wigner–Weyl quantization and to the Keldysh technique. We show how such concepts as the Wigner function, Weyl symbol, Moyal product, Bopp operators, and others automatically emerge from the Feynmann's path integral representation of the evolution in the Heisenberg representation. We illustrate the applicability of this expansion with various examples mostly in the context of cold atom systems including sine-Gordon model, one- and two-dimensional Bose–Hubbard model, Dicke model and others.},

A pump laser beam is aligned collinearly with an expanded plane parallel probe beam by a dichroic mirror. These beams pass through the sample, while right behind the sample using a suitable bandpass ﬁlter the pump beam is intercepted. The distorted probe beam then passes through a double-grating interferometer. One of the lateral shearing interference patterns is recorded by use of a {CCD} camera and, after digitization, has been stored in a computer. The interference pattern is analyzed by means of a Fourier transform algorithm. The refractive index changes have been obtained from phase distribution of the recorded fringe patterns. The implementation of the technique is straightforward and the arrangement is very simple and stable yet its sensitivity is comparable with other interferometry methods. It is also not a time consuming method. The method is applied for measuring the thermal nonlinear refractive index n2 of colloidal gold nanoparticles in water solution.},

First, we find the most general acoustic geometry compatible with the fluid dynamic equations in a collapsing/expanding perfect fluid line vortex. Second, we demonstrate that there is a suitable choice of coordinates on the equatorial slice through a Kerr black hole that puts it into this vortex form though it is not possible to put the entire Kerr spacetime into perfect fluid ‘acoustic’ form. Finally, we discuss the implications of this formal equivalence both with respect to gaining insight into the Kerr spacetime and with respect to possible vortex-inspired experiments, and indicate ways in which more general analogue spacetimes might be constructed.},

Whereas complex quantum states can be created for electrons in solid-state materials through mere cooling, optical manipulation and control builds on nonthermodynamic methods. Using an optical dye microcavity, we show that photon wave packets can be split through thermalization within a potential with two minima subject to tunnel coupling. At room temperature, photons condense into a quantum-coherent bifurcated ground state. Fringe signals upon recombination show the relative coherence between the two wells, demonstrating a working interferometer with the nonunitary thermodynamic beam splitter. Our energetically driven optical-state preparation method provides a route for exploring correlated and entangled optical many-body states.},

  abstract = {In this paper we discuss, within the Gross-Pitaevskii framework, superfluidity, soliton-like patterns, and instabilities in a nonequilibrium polariton fluid injected by a spatially localized and continuous-wave coherent pump and flowing against a defect located outside the pump spot. In contrast to equilibrium condensates of ultracold atoms or liquid helium, the steady-state solutions of the driven-dissipative equations in this specific geometry hardly show a clean superfluid flow around the defect and rather feature a crossover from shallow to deep soliton-like perturbation. This is explained in terms of the properties of one-dimensional flows, in particular their weak dependence on the pump parameters and their rapid transition to a supersonic regime under the effect of the quantum pressure. The role of disorder and of an incoherent reservoir in inducing nonstationary behaviors with moving phase singularities is also highlighted. Such complex and highly nonlinear behaviors call for quantitative experimental tests of the underlying Gross-Pitaevskii equation.},

  abstract  = {In a homogeneous two-dimensional system at nonzero temperature, although there can be no ordering of inﬁnite range, a superﬂuid phase is expected to occur for a Bose particle system. Theory predicts that, in this phase, the correlation function decays with distance as a power law, and quantum vortices are bound to antivortices to form molecular-like pairs. We study the relevance of this theory to microcavity exciton polaritons. These are two-dimensional bosonic quasiparticles formed as a superposition of a microcavity photon and a semiconductor quantum well exciton and have been shown to condense at high enough densities. Because of the short lifetime, full equilibrium is not established, but we instead probe the steady state of the system, in which particles are continuously injected from a pumping reservoir.},

In this approach the quantum field evolution can be represented using equations of motion of a similar form to the Gross–Pitaevskii equation but with stochastic modifications that include quantum effects in a controlled degree of approximation. These techniques provide a practical quantitative description of both equilibrium and dynamical properties of Bose gas systems. We develop versions of the formalism appropriate at zero temperature, where quantum fluctuations can be important, and at finite temperature where thermal fluctuations dominate. The numerical techniques necessary for implementing the formalism are discussed in detail, together with methods for extracting observables of interest. Numerous applications to a wide range of phenomena are presented.},

The transmitted light shows a transition from a single-peaked spectrum to a double-peaked spectrum above the threshold of the lower branch. Fluctuations in the field are reduced on the upper branch and both photon bunching and photon antibunching are predicted, for different operating points. An exact solution obtained for the steady-state generalised P function shows decidedly non-equilibrium behaviour, e.g. the lack of a Maxwell construction.},

We discuss in particular the Bogoliubov character of the excitations of a lower polariton superfluid when it coexists with upper polaritons. We show unique effects resulting from the interplay between polariton decay and Bogoliubov transformation such as the modification of the Bogoliubov dispersion or the slowing down of the four-wave mixing dynamics.},

"Which of these bizarre phenomena, if any, can really exist in our universe? Black holes, down which anything can fall but from which nothing can return; wormholes, short spacewarps connecting regions of the cosmos; singularities, where space and time are so violently warped that time ceases to exist and space becomes a kind of foam; gravitational waves, which carry symphonic accounts of collisions of black holes billions of years ago; and time machines, for traveling backward and forward in time." "Kip Thorne, along with fellow theorists Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose, a cadre of Russians, and earlier scientists such as Oppenheimer, Wheeler and Chandrasekhar, has been in the thick of the quest to secure answers. In this masterfully written and brilliantly informed work of scientific history and explanation, Dr. Thorne, the Feynman Professor of Theoretical Physics at Caltech, leads his readers through an elegant, always human, tapestry of interlocking themes, coming finally to a uniquely informed answer to the great question: what principles control our universe and why do physicists think they know the things they think they know?" "Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time has been one of the greatest best-sellers in publishing history.

  abstract = {In spite of the fundamental difficulties associated with the thermodynamics of self-gravitating systems, the objects known as black holes appear to conform to a very straightforward generalisation of standard laboratory thermodynamics. In this review the generalised theory is examined in detail. It is shown how familiar concepts such as temperature, entropy, specific heats, phase transitions and irreversibility apply to systems containing black holes, and some concrete results of the theory are presented. The thermodynamic connection is based on Hawking’s celebrated application of quantum theory to black holes, and in this review the quantum aspects are described in detail from several standpoints, both heuristic and otherwise. The precise mechanism by which the black hole produces thermal radiation, its nature and origin, and the energetics of back-reaction on the hole are reviewed. The thermal states of quantum holes are also treated using the theory of thermal Green functions, and the entropy of the hole is shown to be related to the loss of information about the quantum states hidden behind the event horizon. Some related topics such as accelerated mirrors and observers in Minkowski space, super-radiance from rotating holes and the thermodynamics of general self-gravitating systems are also briefly discussed.},

Few-cycle pulses create a system of two pulses: a Raman shifting soliton traps a pulse in the normal dispersion regime. When the soliton approaches a wavelength of zero group velocity dispersion the Raman shifting abruptly terminates and the trapped pulse is released. In particular, the trap is less than 4 ps long and contains a 1 ps pulse. After being released, this pulse asymmetrically expands to more than 10 ps. Additionally, there is no disturbance of the trapping dynamics at high input pulse energies as the supercontinuum develops further.},

This configuration is initially prepared starting from a homogeneous flow via a suitable space-dependent change of the interaction constant. The evolution is numerically followed to long times: depending on the parameters, the system typically either converges to the lowest energy solution by evaporating away the horizons or displays a continuous and periodic coherent emission of solitons. Movies of the temporal evolution of the spatial density pro!file in the most significant cases are attached as Supplemental Material. By making a physical comparison with optical laser devices, we identify the latter regime of continuous emission of solitons as the proper black-hole laser effect.},

  abstract   = {Quasinormal modes are a set of damped resonances that describe how an excited open system is driven back to equilibrium. In gravitational physics these modes characterise the ringdown of a perturbed black hole, e.g. following a binary black hole merger. A careful analysis of the ringdown spectrum reveals the properties of the black hole, such as its angular momentum and mass. In more complex gravitational systems the spectrum might depend on more parameters, and hence allows us to search for new physics. In this letter we present a hydrodynamic analogue of a rotating black hole, that illustrates how the presence of extra structure affects the quasinormal mode spectrum. The analogy is obtained by considering wave scattering on a draining bathtub vortex flow. We show that due to vorticity of the background flow, the resulting field theory corresponds to a scalar field on an effective curved spacetime which acquires a local mass in the vortex core. The obtained quasinormal mode spectrum exhibits long-lived trapped modes, commonly known as quasibound states. Our findings can be tested in future experiments, building up on recent successful implementations of analogue rotating black holes.},

Among its many applications in Physics, Biology, Chemistry and other fields, the possibility of identifying objects and structures through their emission spectra is remarkable and incredibly useful. In this paper we apply the spectroscopy idea to a numerically simulated hydrodynamical flow, with the goal of developing a new, noninvasive flow measurement technique. Our focus lies on an irrotational draining vortex, which can be seen, under specific conditions, as the analogue of a rotating black hole (historically named a dumb hole). This paper is a development of a recent experiment that suggests that irrotational vortices and rotating black holes share a common relaxation process, known as the ringdown phase. We apply techniques borrowed from black hole physics to identify vortex flows from their characteristic spectrum emitted during this ringdown phase. We believe that this technique is a new facet of the fluidgravity analogy and constitutes a promising way to investigate experimentally vortex flows in fluids and superfluids alike.},

  abstract   = {Black holes are like bells; once perturbed they will relax through the emission of characteristic waves. The frequency spectrum of these waves is independent of the initial perturbation and, hence, can be thought of as a `fingerprint' of the black hole. Since the 1970s scientists have considered the possibility of using these characteristic modes of oscillation to identify astrophysical black holes. With the recent detection of gravitational waves, this idea has started to turn into reality. Inspired by the black hole-fluid analogy, we demonstrate the universality of the black-hole relaxation process through the observation of characteristic modes emitted by a hydrodynamical vortex flow. The characteristic frequency spectrum is measured and agrees with theoretical predictions obtained using techniques developed for astrophysical black holes. Our findings allow for the first identification of a hydrodynamical vortex flow through its characteristic waves. The flow velocities inferred from the observed spectrum agree with a direct flow measurement. Our approach establishes a non-invasive method, applicable to vortex flows in fluids and superfluids alike, to identify the wave-current interactions and hence the effective field theories describing such systems.},

It was proven for a sonic case that if these two horizons are close to each other their dynamics resemble a laser, a black hole laser, where the analogue of Hawking radiation is trapped and amplified. Optical analogues are also very successful and a similar system can be achieved there. In this work we develop the theory of optical black hole lasers and prove that the amplification is also possible. Then, we study the optical system by determining the forward propagation of modes, obtaining an approximation for the phase difference which governs the amplification, and performing numerical simulations of the pulse propagation of our system.},

  abstract   = {In this work we consider the problem of reconstruction of a signal from the magnitude of its Fourier transform, also known as phase retrieval. The problem arises in many areas of astronomy, crystallography, optics, and coherent diffraction imaging ({CDI}). Our main goal is to develop an efficient reconstruction method based on continuous optimization techniques. Unlike current reconstruction methods, which are based on alternating projections, our approach leads to a much faster and more robust method. However, all previous attempts to employ continuous optimization methods, such as Newton-type algorithms, to the phase retrieval problem failed. In this work we provide an explanation for this failure, and based on this explanation we devise a sufficient condition that allows development of new reconstruction methods---approximately known Fourier phase. We demonstrate that a rough (up to \${\textbackslash}pi/2\$ radians) Fourier phase estimate practically guarantees successful reconstruction by any reasonable method. We also present a new reconstruction method whose reconstruction time is orders of magnitude faster than that of the current method-of-choice in phase retrieval---Hybrid Input-Output ({HIO}). Moreover, our method is capable of successful reconstruction even in the situations where {HIO} is known to fail. We also extended our method to other applications: Fourier domain holography, and interferometry. Additionally we developed a new sparsity-based method for sub-wavelength {CDI}. Using this method we demonstrated experimental resolution exceeding several times the physical limit imposed by the diffraction light properties (so called diffraction limit).},

For three given physical parameters - i.e. wavelength, propagation distance and pixel size the computational width in the Fresnel-Transform is fixed. This width can be larger than the real dimension of the input or output images. Consequently, it can induce a padding around the real input and output without given amplitude (intensity) values. To solve this problem, we propose a very simple and efficient solution and compare it to other approaches. We demonstrate that the new modified {GSA} provides almost perfect results without losing the time efficiency of the simplest method.},

The method uses four frames obtained by integration of the time-varying intensity in an interference pattern during the four quarters of the modulation period. An optimum sinusoidal phase modulation is found to minimize the effect of the additive noise. The absolute accuracy of the phase measurements is discussed. Possible applications of the method are demonstrated with two interference microscopes with which the phase modulation is achieved by sinusoidal oscillation of a mirror attached to a piezoelectric transducer and by sinusoidal birefringence modulation with a photoelastic modulator. In both experimental arrangements, phase images can be produced in real time at a rate of several hertz. Noise measurements are reported and compared with theory.},

  abstract   = {Wavefront sensing is the simultaneous measurement of the amplitude and phase of an incoming optical ﬁeld. Traditional wavefront sensors such as Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor ({SHWFS}) suffer from a fundamental tradeoff between spatial resolution and phase estimation and consequently can only achieve a resolution of a few thousand pixels. To break this tradeoff, we present a novel computational-imaging-based technique, namely, the Wavefront Imaging Sensor with High resolution ({WISH}). We replace the microlens array in {SHWFS} with a spatial light modulator ({SLM}) and use a computational phase-retrieval algorithm to recover the incident wavefront. This wavefront sensor can measure highly varying optical ﬁelds at more than 10-megapixel resolution with the ﬁne phase estimation. To the best of our knowledge, this resolution is an order of magnitude higher than the current noninterferometric wavefront sensors. To demonstrate the capability of {WISH}, we present three applications, which cover a wide range of spatial scales. First, we produce the diffraction-limited reconstruction for long-distance imaging by combining {WISH} with a large-aperture, low-quality Fresnel lens. Second, we show the recovery of high-resolution images of objects that are obscured by scattering. Third, we show that {WISH} can be used as a microscope without an objective lens. Our study suggests that the designing principle of {WISH}, which combines optical modulators and computational algorithms to sense high-resolution optical ﬁelds, enables improved capabilities in many existing applications while revealing entirely new, hitherto unexplored application areas.},

We show that, in 1D channels, an odd (1 or 3) or even (2 or 4) number of dark solitons form parallel to the channel axis in order to accommodate the phase constraint induced by the pumps in the barriers. These soliton molecules are typically unstable and evolve toward stationary symmetric or antisymmetric arrays of vortex streets straightforwardly observable in cw experiments. The flexibility of this photonic platform allows implementing more complicated potentials such as mazelike channels, with the vortex streets connecting the entrances and thus solving the maze.},

Based on a weak support field, it allows for the extended propagation of a resonantly driven polariton superfluid with minimal energetic cost. Moreover, this setup is based on optical bistability and leads to the significant release of the phase constraint imposed by resonant driving. This release, together with macroscopic polariton propagation, offers a unique opportunity to study the hydrodynamics of the topological excitations of polariton superfluids such as quantized vortices and dark solitons. We numerically study how the coherent field supporting the superfluid flow interacts with the vortices and how it can be used to control them. Interestingly, we show that standard hydrodynamics does not apply for this driven-dissipative fluid and new types of behaviour are identified.},

  abstract = {In most classical fluids, shock waves are strongly dissipative, their energy being quickly lost through viscous damping. But in systems such as cold plasmas, superfluids and Bose–Einstein condensates, where viscosity is negligible or non-existent, a fundamentally different type of shock wave can emerge whose behaviour is dominated by dispersion rather than dissipation. Dispersive shock waves are difficult to study experimentally, and analytical solutions to the equations that govern them have only been found in one dimension (1D). By exploiting a well-known, but little appreciated, correspondence between the behaviour of superfluids and nonlinear optical materials, we demonstrate an all-optical experimental platform for studying the dynamics of dispersive shock waves. This enables us to observe the propagation and nonlinear response of dispersive shock waves, including the interaction of colliding shock waves, in 1D and 2D. Our system offers a versatile and more accessible means for exploring superfluid-like and related dispersive phenomena.},

  abstract = {The Rayleigh–Taylor instability ({RTI}) is a fundamental fluid instability that occurs when a light fluid is accelerated into a heavier one. While techniques for observing the {RTI} in classical fluids continue to improve, the instability has not been demonstrated in quantum fluids. Here, we exploit the formal equivalence between condensed matter and coherent nonlinear optics to observe the superfluid-like instability directly in the optical system. For the {RTI}, an initial refractive index gradient sets the acceleration, while self-induced nonlinear interactions lead to velocity differences and shear. The experimental observations show that density fingering is always accompanied by vortex generation, with perturbation modes following a hybrid dynamics: horizontal modes (along the interface) propagate as an incompressible fluid, but the vertical length scale (mixing length) is set by compressible shock dynamics. The growth rate, obtained analytically, shows that inhibition due to diffraction has the same spectral form as viscosity and diffusion, despite the fact that the system is dispersive rather than dissipative. This gives rigorous support for the observation that turbulence in quantum fluids has the same scaling as turbulence in normal fluids. The results hold for any Schrödinger flow, e.g. superfluids and quantum plasma, and introduce a new class of fluid-inspired instabilities in nonlinear optics.},

  doi      = {10.1038/nphys2406},
  abstract = {Magnetic monopoles 1 are point-like sources of magnetic field, never observed as fundamental particles. This has triggered the search for monopole analogues in the form of emergent particles in the solid state, with recent observations in spin-ice crystals 2-4 and one-dimensional ferromagnetic nanowires 5 . Alternatively, topological excitations of spinor Bose-Einstein condensates have been predicted to demonstrate monopole textures 6-8 . Here we show the formation of monopole analogues in an exciton-polariton spinor condensate hitting a defect 9,10 potential in a semiconductor microcavity. Oblique dark solitons are nucleated in the wake of the defect in the presence of an effective magnetic field acting on the polariton pseudo-spin 11 . The field splits the integer soliton into a pair of oblique half-solitons 12 of opposite magnetic charge, subject to opposite effective magnetic forces. These mixed spin-phase excitations thus behave like one-dimensional monopoles 13 . Our results open the way to the generation of stable magnetic currents in photonic quantum fluids. © 2012 Macmillan !publishers Limited.},

A variant of the z-scan technique is applied for which we scan the laser frequency across resonance for different sample positions and detect the transmission after an aperture in the far field. From the spectra for different positions we reconstruct the position-dependent transmission z-scan curve for a given laser detuning. This technique allows obtaining the vapor Kerr coefficient over a large and continuous range of frequencies. From the saturation of the Kerr coefficient, n2, with beam power we obtain n4, the next term in the refraction index expansion. A theoretical model is used to calculate n2 and n4 giving values consistent with experimental ones.},

  abstract = {The Kerr family of solutions of the Einstein and Einstein-Maxwell equations is the most general class of solutions known at present which could represent the field of a rotating neutral or electrically charged body in asymptotically flat space. When the charge and specific angular momentum are small compared with the mass, the part of the manifold which is stationary in the strict sense is incomplete at a Killing horizon. Analytically extended manifolds are constructed in order to remove this incompleteness. Some general methods for the analysis of causal behavior are described and applied. It is shown that in all except the spherically symmetric cases there is nontrivial causality violation, i.e., there are closed timelike lines which are not removable by taking a covering space; moreover, when the charge or angular momentum is so large that there are no Killing horizons, this causality violation is of the most flagrant possible kind in that it is possible to connect any event to any other by a future-directed timelike line. Although the symmetries provide only three constants of the motion, a fourth one turns out to be obtainable from the unexpected separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, with the result that the equations, not only of geodesics but also of charged-particle orbits, can be integrated completely in terms of explicit quadratures. This makes it possible to prove that in the extended manifolds all geodesics which do not reach the central ring singularities are complete, and also that those timelike or null geodesics which do reach the singularities are entirely confined to the equator, with the further restriction, in the charged case, that they be null with a certain uniquely determined direction. The physical significance of these results is briefly discussed.},

  abstract    = {Controllably producing optical photons and making them interact are two key requirements for the development of long-distance quantum communications, and more generally for photonic quantum information processing. This thesis presents experimental studies on possible solutions to these two problems, using the conversion of the photons into collective excitations (polaritons) in a cold atomic cloud, inside the mode of a low-finesse optical cavity ({\textasciitilde}100). Firstly, ground-state polaritons are used to store a single excitation in the cloud memory. This polariton is then efficiently converted into a single photon, whose field is characterized via homodyne tomography. The single photon state’s Wigner function is reconstructed from the experimental data and exhibits negative values, demonstrating that the photon’s degrees of freedom (spatio-temporal mode and quantum state) are well controlled. Secondly, photons can be coupled to polaritons involving Rydberg states. The strong dipolar interactions between these give rise to very strong optical dispersive nonlinearities, that are characterized in a classical excitation regime. These nonlinearities can be amplified until a single photon is enough to modify the entire system’s response, allowing in principle for the generation of effective photon-photon interactions.},

We give closed formulas for the scattering angle for sound rays, formulate the sound-propagation problem in the Hamiltonian form and discuss the form of boundary conditions at the core of the vortex, where the Hamiltonian has a singular point. The wave equation is simplified to a single ordinary differential equation of Mathieu type. We give an extensive discussion of perturbations localized close to the core, which are similar to what is known as the Kelvin waves for vortices that are bendable (not pinned). The spectra of modes depend strongly on the type of boundary condition employed close to the vortex core. The gapless mode with the angular number −1, the Kelvin mode usually discussed in the context of unpinned vortices in superfluid helium or rotating Bose–Einstein condensates, turns out either not to exist or to have a completely different dispersion relation if the vortex is pinned. The question of whether or not the acoustic spacetime admits an ergoregion turns out to have a decisive (qualitative) influence on many aspects of sound-propagation phenomena.},

  abstract = {Waves on the surface of a fluid provide a powerful tool for studying the fluid itself and the surrounding physical environment. For example, the wave speed is determined by the force per unit mass at the surface, and by the depth of the fluid1: the decreasing speed of ocean waves as they approach the shore reveals the changing depth of the sea and the strength of gravity. Other examples include propagating waves in neutron-star oceans2 and on the surface of levitating liquid drops3. Although gravity is a common restoring force, others exist, including the electrostatic force which causes a thin liquid film to adhere to a solid. Usually surface waves cannot occur on such thin films because viscosity inhibits their motion. However, in the special case of thin films of superfluid 4He, surface waves do exist and are called ‘third sound’. Here we report the detection of similar surface waves in thin films of superfluid 3He. We describe studies of the speed of these waves, the properties of the surface force, and the film's superfluid density.},

Interactions of the film with both the He vapor and the substrate which are in contract with it are included and discussed in detail. Boundary conditions for both the film-substrate and film-gas interfaces are derived. It is indicated how one may construct the equations of motion for the entire coupled system (gas-film-substrate). The equations are actually constructed and solved for the case when a certain parameter is small, which includes all the third-sound experiments on unsaturated films. A dispersion equation is found which is exact in the limit of vanishing frequency, and which is eminently suited to describe both the velocity and the attenuation of third sound in the regime of unsaturated films. No hydrodynamic instability is found. Results for the attenuation are shown to be in good agreement with preliminary experiments on unsaturated He films.},

Third sound is a surface wave of long wavelength on a liquid helium film during which the normal component remains stationary and the superfluid component oscillates parallel to the wall. To treat this properly it is necessary to consider temperature changes and evaporation from the surface of the film. Fourth sound may exist in narrow two-sided channels. The normal component again remains stationary and the superfluid component oscillates parallel to the wall, but the width of the channel must remain fixed and so there are oscillations in both total density and temperature.},

We implement a study of how basic, well understood vortex states, such as a propagating pair of oppositely signed vortices, change in the presence of particles by using a simple model based on the Magnus force. We focus on the two-dimensional case, and compare the analytic and semianalytic models with simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii ({GP}) equation with particles modeled by dynamic external potentials. The results confirm that the Magnus force model is an effective way to approximate vortex-particle motion either with closed-form simplified solutions or with a more accurate numerically solvable ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, we increase the complexity of the vortex states and show that the suggested semianalytical model remains robust in capturing the dynamics observed in the {GP} simulations.},

While we place the emphasis on elementary excitations such as phonons and rotons, our formalism applies also to macroscopic objects such as vortex rings and rigid bodies interacting with long-wavelength fluid modes. Within our approach, we reproduce phonon decay and phonon-phonon scattering as predicted using a purely field-theoretic description of phonons. We also correct classic results by Landau and Khalatnikov on roton-phonon scattering. Finally, we discuss how phonons and rotons couple to gravity, and show that the former tend to float while the latter tend to sink but with rather peculiar trajectories. Our formalism can be easily extended to include (general) relativistic effects and couplings to additional matter fields. As such, it can be relevant in contexts as diverse as neutron star physics and light dark matter detection.},

Is it optical pumping that ﬁrst prepares a thermal ensemble, with coherent superposition developing subsequently or is it the other way round: coherently superposed atoms driven to steady state via optical pumping? Using a stroboscopic probing technique, here we experimentally explore these questions. A 100 ns pulse is used to probe an experimentally simulated, closed three-level, Λ-like conﬁguration in rubidium atoms, driven by strong coherent (control ) and incoherent ﬁelds. Temporal evolution of probe transmission shows an initial overshoot with turn-on of control, resulting in a scenario akin to lasing without inversion ({LWI}). The corresponding rise time is dictated by coherent dynamics, with a distinct experimental signature of halfcycle Rabi ﬂop in a thermal ensemble of atoms. Our results indicate that, in fact, optical pumping drives the atoms to a steady state in a signiﬁcantly longer time-scale that sustains superposed dark states. Eventual control turn-oﬀ leads to a sudden fall in transmission with an ubiquitous signature for identifying closed and open systems. Numerical simulations and toy-model predictions conﬁrm our claims. These studies reveal new insights into a rich and complex dynamics associated with atoms in thermal ensemble, which are otherwise absent in state-prepared, cold atomic ensembles.},

  abstract   = {Detailed analysis of spectral line broadening and variations in relative intensities of hyperfine spectral components due to optical pumping is presented. Hyperfine levels of sodium \$3p\_\{1/2\}\$ and \$3p\_\{3/2\}\$ levels are selectively excited in a supersonic beam at various laser intensities under the conditions when optical pumping time is shorter than transit time of atoms through the laser beam. The excitation spectra exhibit significant line broadening at laser intensities well below the saturation intensity, and redistribution of intensities of hyperfine spectral components is observed, which in some cases is contradicting with intuitive expectations. Theoretical analysis of the dynamics of optical pumping shows that spectral line broadening depends sensitively on branching coefficient of the laser-driven transition. Analytical expressions for branching ratio dependent critical Rabi frequency and critical laser intensity are derived, which give the threshold for onset of noticeable line broadening by optical pumping. Transitions with larger and smaller branching coefficients are relatively less affected. The theoretical excitation spectra were calculated numerically by solving density matrix equations of motion using the split propagation technique, and they well reproduce the observed effects of line broadening and peak intensity variations. The calculations also show that presence of dark (i.e., not laser- coupled) Zeeeman sublevels in the lower state results in effective branching coefficients which vary with laser intensity and differ from those implied by the sum rules, and this can lead to peculiar changes in peak ratios of hyperfine components of the spectra.},

  abstract  = {Multiple-wave achromatic interferometric techniques are used to measure, with high accuracy and high transverse resolution, wave fronts of polychromatic light sources. The wave fronts to be measured are replicated by a diffraction grating into several copies interfering together, leading to an interference pattern. A CCD detector located in the vicinity of the grating records this interference pattern. Some of these wave-front sensors are able to resolve wave-front spatial frequencies 3 to 4 times higher than a conventional Shack--Hartmann technique using an equivalent CCD detector. Its dynamic is also much higher, 2 to 3 orders of magnitude.}
